# Dynamic Flowers 

A visual experience of blooming flowers created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I put together this little blooming flowers project, but let's be real—it’s more of a “watered-down” version of something much cooler. Major credits go to the original genius over at [MdUsmanAnsari](https://github.com/MdUsmanAnsari). I just planted the seeds! 🌱

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the layout for the blooming flower visuals.
- **style.css**: Defines the animations and styles for the flower and grass elements, giving them realistic growth patterns.
- **main.js**: Adds a delay of 1 second on page load before removing the `not-loaded` class from the body, triggering the animations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Flower Animation**: CSS animations bring the flowers to life with realistic blooming and grass growth effects.
- **Customizable Apology Message**: Modify the `"Add your message here"` in the `.apology-text` div in `index.html` to personalize the message displayed on the page.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nerdylelouch/Flowers.git
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the blooming flowers animation.
